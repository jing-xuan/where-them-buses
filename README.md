# Where my bus?

A bus timing display was my first web development project in 2016. After seeing so many mobile apps
and myself try to squeeze the maximum amount of information about the buses into a small screen while ensuring
the display style was intuitive to understand, I wanted to try to make the most intuitive display possible -
by drawing out the entire scene you will see at the bus stop, assuming the roads are straight and every bus is in a
straight line.

As I learn more design and web dev, I hope to make this the most realistic bus timing display ever. 

All drawings used are self-drawn.
